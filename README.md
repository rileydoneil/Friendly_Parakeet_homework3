## Purpose

This was a challenge to build a password generator that prompts the user into defining what characteristics are required, then spitting out the randomly generated password to the window for the user to copy.

## Lessons

This assignmet taught me how we can utilize the power of JS to perform many operations in the backend and have those operations reveal themselves through the html site. This had a much more practical application of applying functional coding similar to other langages I'm more comfortable with.
